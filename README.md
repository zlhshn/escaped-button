## Escaped Button ðŸ’¨ðŸ™‚
## Description
I created this project to learn how to use form elements with React. <br>
Validation => <br>
âœ” Filling in all fields,<br>
âœ” The email must be valid => contain @, have 2 or 3 digits after the @ sign,<br>
âœ” Ä°mage must be a url.<br>

* If the user navigates to the button without providing validation, preventing the user from clicking the button
* When the form is submitted, the information is displayed as a card structure at the bottom and the inputs in the form are emptied.
* Setting whether to display the password when the Show/Hidden button is clicked.
